The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo[1] in the late 1980s.[2] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

There are six steps in the original technique:

1)Decide on the task to be done.
2)Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3)Work on the task.
4)End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5)If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
6)After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
